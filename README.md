# Search Engine

## Overview
This project implements a simple search engine that indexes web pages and allows users to perform keyword searches. The program processes a specified text file containing URLs and their corresponding content, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant web pages based on user queries.

## Features
- **Input File Processing**: The program reads a text file that contains URLs and their associated content for indexing.
- **Keyword Search**: Users can perform searches using keywords and special characters.
- **Indexing**: The search engine builds an index from the content of the web pages, allowing quick lookups.
- **Query Support**: Supports single keywords, combined queries, and negations (e.g., `fish -red`).

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- VSCode or any compatible IDE
- Ensure that the text files (Ex: `tiny.txt`) are present in the working directory.

## Testing
You can uncomment the testing line in the `main()` function to execute built-in tests for various functionalities. Ensure the test files (Ex: `tiny.txt`) are available in the working directory.

### Happy Searching!
